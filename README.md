## What Is a PoE Ethernet Switch?

A PoE Ethernet switch is a network switch that supplies both data and electrical power over standard Ethernet cables to connected devices such as IP cameras, access points, phones, and IoT devices.

Key points:

- Provides power over Ethernet ports according to IEEE 802.3af and 802.3at standards  
- Delivers centralized power management and simplifies cabling infrastructure  
- Supports higher power devices when using PoE+ capable switches  
- Offers managed features for network monitoring, VLANs, and security protocols  
- Suitable for large network environments needing high port counts and bandwidth options
